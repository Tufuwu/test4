mirrorlist_server.py is the daemon process that has the cached data,
and fork()s for every request.

mirrorlist_client.wsgi is the apache process, running under mod_wsgi,
that takes the request, connects to mirrorlist_server.py, gets a
response and passes it back to the user.

test/server_tester.py was a hack late one night to throw requests
at the server rapidly and randomly.  Found quite a few bugs with it,
so haven't erased it yet.
