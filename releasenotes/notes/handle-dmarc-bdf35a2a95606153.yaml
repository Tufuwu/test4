    To avoid triggering spam filters due to failed signature validation, many
    mailing lists mangle the From header to change the From address to be the
    address of the list, typically where the sender's domain has a strict DMARC
    policy enabled. This leads to incorrect senders being recorded. We now try
    to unmangle the From header using the X-Original-From or Reply-To headers,
    as used by Google Groups and Mailman respectively.
