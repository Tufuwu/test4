features:

    The ``patch-delegated``, ``patch-state-changed`` and ``check-created``
    events now have an ``actor`` associated with them - the user that updated
    the patch or created the check. For other event types, this attribute is
    present but unset.
api:
  - |
    The ``/event`` API now exposes an ``actor`` attribute. It is possible to
    filter events by this attribute.
