    The v2.0.0 release includes many new features and bug fixes. For full
    information on the options avaiable, you should look at the full release
    notes in detail. However, there are two key features that make v2.0.0 a
    worthwhile upgrade:

    - A REST API is now provided, which will eventually replace the legacy
      XML-RPC API
    - Patch series and series cover letters are now supported

    For further information on these features and the other changes in this
    release, review the full release notes.
