prelude: |
  There are two main changes in this release: the removal of Python 2.7 support
  and the resolution of the longstanding performance issues introduced by the
  ``Submission`` model. On top of this, there is the usual bump in
  requirements, a significant amount of fixes to the documentation for the
  REST API, and the squashing of all migrations introduced in versions up to
  and including v2.2.0.
