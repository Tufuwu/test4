    Series, patches and cover letters can be filtered by submitter using email
    addresses. For example:

    .. code-block:: shell

       $ curl /covers/?submitter=stephen@that.guru

    Bundles can be filtered by owner, patches by delegate and checks by user
    using username. For example:

    .. code-block:: shell

       $ curl /bundles/?owner=stephenfin

    Filters can now be specified multiple times. For example:

    .. code-block:: shell

       $ curl /patches/?state=under-review&state=rfc

    This operates as a logical OR: it will retrieve patches that are either
    Under Review or RFC.
