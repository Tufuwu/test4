    In the past, Patchwork used to support filtering patches that weren't
    delegated to anyone. This feature was removed in v1.1.0, as part of a patch
    designed to support delegation to anyone. However, that feature didn't scale
    and was later removed. The ability to delegate to anyone is now itself
    re-introduced.
