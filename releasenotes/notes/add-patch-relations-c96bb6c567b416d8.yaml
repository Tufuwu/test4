    Patches can now be related to other patches (e.g. to cross-reference
    revisions). Relations can be set via the REST API by maintainers
    (currently only for patches of projects they maintain). Patches can
    belong to at most one relation at a time.

    Relations are available via ``/patches/{patchID}/`` endpoint, in
    the ``related`` field.
