Installation instructions
=========================

|project_program| is designed for Python **3** and does not work with Python 2.

Requirements
------------

The minimal requirements are.

* `Python 3`_
* `psutil`_

Additionally, the some checks need further dependencies to function properly.
Please refer to :ref:`available-checks` for individual requirements.

If checks using URLs to load data should support ``file://`` URLs, `requests-file`_ is needed.
