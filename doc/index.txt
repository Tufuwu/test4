Documentation of the Python client for the EBRAINS Neuromorphic Computing Platform
==================================================================================

The Neuromorphic Computing Platform of the EBRAINS_ infrastructure (developed by the `Human Brain Project`_)
contains two very different neuromorphic hardware systems - BrainScaleS (aka "physical model") 
and SpiNNaker (aka "many core") - but has a single interface.

Jobs are submitted to a queue server, then executed on one of the neuromorphic systems. On job completion, the user
may retrieve the results of the simulation/emulation.

There are several ways of interacting with the queue server. This document describes the Python client, which allows
scripted access to the Platform. The same client software is used both by end users for submitting jobs to the
queue, and by the hardware systems to take jobs off the queue and to post the results.
