A collection of email threads stored in mbox format. These should validate
Patchwork's ability to handle series, particularly tricky edge cases. Feel free
to extend, following the below guidelines:

* Each individual mails should be short. Ideally you should create a new,
  simple email that replicates the behavior of the original email.
* Remove any unnecessary headers and other data, including anything
  confidential

The above should help keep tests fast and succinct.

## How to add your own

Most of these emails were generated by sending emails from one email address
using `git send-email`, and reading/saving them from another using `mutt`.
Once saved, most non-standard headers can be removed (basically anything
beginning with `X-` along with email client-specific headers like `Status:`).
Finally, save the email with a name corresponding the tests.
