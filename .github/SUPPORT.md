# A note about django-extra-views maintenance

Dear fellow Pythonista: This project is currently in maintenance mode -- it was abandoned by the original author and taken into custody by me, @jonashaag.

I can't spend a lot of time on the project, but will do my best to triage any issues and give guidance for those who want to contribute patches to the project.

If you find any bugs in this library, **please consider submitting a pull request** that fixes your bug, even if it's trivial to fix.

On a related note: If you've ever wanted to become a core member of an open-source project, this is your chance :-) Contact me at jonas %AT% lophus %DOT% org.
