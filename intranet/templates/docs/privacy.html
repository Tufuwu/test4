    <h3 class="block-center-heading" id="eighth-period-signup-information">Eighth Period Signup Information</h3>
    <p>The eighth period signup information for students is by default only visible to TJ staff members and Intranet administrators.  Without action by a student, this means that the activities they sign up for are not visible to other student users of Ion.</p>
    <br>
    <p>At all times, students retain the ability to see their name on their activity's roster.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Due to changes in FCPS policy, we do not offer a way for new students to grant permission for their eighth period information to become available to other students, and this text is only maintained for compatibility purposes.</p>
