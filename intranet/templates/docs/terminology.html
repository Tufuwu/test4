    <p>The volunteer TJHSST Intranet Team has worked extremely hard to put together this useful web application for the school. Out of respect for the time and effort of the Intranet Team, please refer to Ion correctly.</p>
    <p><b>Ion should NOT be referred to as "ION" (in all caps).</b> Ion is not an acronym nor has it ever been one.</p>
