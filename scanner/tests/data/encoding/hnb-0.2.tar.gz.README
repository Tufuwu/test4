WHAT IS hierarchical notebook?
	
	hierarchical notebook (hnb) is program to organize, many kinds
	of data in one place,  for example  adresses, todo lists, ideas,
	book "reviews". 
	
HOW TO GET hnb?
	
	new releases of hnb will appear on the sourceforge
	project page
	
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/hnb
	
INSTALLING hnb
	
	if you've got a source release you must first compile
	hnb,.. see further down in this file for instructions.
	
	Windows
		the windows binary distribution, is a .zip file
		containing the executable, this readme file, 
		an sample database, and the licence for hnb's use.
		
		the binary is standalone, so you can just
		copy it wherever you'd like it to reside.
		
	Linux
		the linux binary distribution is a .tar.gz file
		containing the executable, this readme file, a
		an sample database, and the licence for hnb's use.
		
		the binary is dynamically linked against ncurses
		just place it anywere in your path.. like
		/usr/bin, /usr/local/bin or /home/user/bin
		
COMPILING hnb
	
	I've only tried to compile hnb using Slackware 7.1,
	but I think it should compile on any unix by
	just typing make.
	
	I cross compile the win32 binary using mingw32, and
	pdcurses,.. to do this might call for some modifications
	of the makefile.
	
USAGE DOCUMENTATION
	
	instructions for the usage of hnb is contained in
	the sample.hnb database file, invoke hnb like this
	in the distribution directory to get further documentation
