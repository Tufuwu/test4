What is the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard?
===============================================

The value from beneficial ownership data comes when we can share it
easily, knowing that it will be correctly understood. Data from
different companies and different countries can then be combined,
visualised, explored and analysed.

Bringing together data from a variety of sources can give us insights
into sprawling or complicated ownership and control structures. But,
without common standards, combining and analysing data from different
sources can be extremely difficult, expensive and time-consuming.

When we only have scattered documents to draw upon, the bigger picture
of beneficial ownership remains obscure.

The Beneficial Ownership Data Standard (BODS) provides a structured data
format, along with guidance for collecting, sharing and using data on
beneficial ownership:

-  The `data schema <../schema/index.html>`__ describes how and what data should be
   shared. It can also inform the design of data collection and
   management systems;

-  The `technical guidance <../schema/guidance/index.html>`__ provides support for publishers and
   users of the data.

Using BODS simplifies the sharing and use of beneficial ownership
information.

The data schema describes how data about the beneficial owners of a
legal entity can be organized and exchanged. The schema is defined in a
structured data format called JSON.

Using the popular JSON format facilitates computerised access and
analysis of the data, whilst also providing human-readable data.

  The **Beneficial Ownership Data Standard** describes what data should be shared and how (using a JSON schema) and provides guidance on data publishing processes and data use.
