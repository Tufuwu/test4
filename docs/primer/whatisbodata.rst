The data is often included in companies’ annual reports, founding

Accessing this data and understanding its relevance to beneficial
ownership can be challenging:

-  The data may only be a small part of a longer document.
-  The same types of data will be represented differently by different
   publishers.
-  Relevant data may appear across different documents.
-  Legal terminology may differ across jurisdictions.

Increasingly, governments and regulatory authorities require beneficial
ownership data to be disclosed and filed in official registers.

These challenges require us to structure and standardise beneficial
ownership data, so that it has a reliable scope and predictable format.


.. highlights::

  Companies already hold data about beneficial ownership. It is not always recorded, stored or shared in consistent ways, making reporting and interpreting reports challenging.
