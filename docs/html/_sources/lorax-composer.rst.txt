lorax-composer
==============

``lorax-composer`` has been replaced by the ``osbuild-composer`` WELDR API
server which implements more features (eg.  ostree, image uploads, etc.) You
can still use ``composer-cli`` and ``cockpit-composer`` with
``osbuild-composer``. See the documentation or the `osbuild website
<https://www.osbuild.org/>`_ for more information.
