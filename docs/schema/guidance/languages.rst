Languages and transliteration
=============================

There may be times when beneficial ownership information needs to be provided in different languages.

(1) For people's names, use an entry in the ``names`` array with a ``type`` of 'translation'
(2) For entity names, use an entry in the ``alternativeNames`` array

For other fields, an ``annotations`` object can be used to indicate that a particular field has a translation or transliteration.
