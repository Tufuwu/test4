**Q: How can I use parameters from a saft equation of state in simulations?**

**A:** There are several references that have shown how to implement these parameters.

**Q: My bubble point calculations aren't converging near the critical point, what to I do?**

**A:** Try adding the Pmin keyword with a pressure value just under the expected final value. As the calculations approach the critical point, it's more difficult for the algorithm to discern the lower limit of feasible pressure values.
